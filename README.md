# Pet-Tracker
An amazing website that tracks multiple animals we keep as pets.

## User Story
AS AN animal lover

I WANT to be able to create a user-friendly game

SO THAT my chosen pet can virtually battle another random pet


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN the Pet Combat Chronicles webpage

WHEN I click on randomize based on a RNG 
THEN I am assigned with a dog to battle & the cpu is assigned a dog to battle .


WHEN I click on “battle”
THEN the user will receive battle boost based on a back end dice roll, as well as the cpu.
Whoever has the higher stats wins the battle

WHEN i finish a battle
THEN I will see a fact about the winning dog
