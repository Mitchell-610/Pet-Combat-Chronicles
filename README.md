# Pet-Combat-Chronicles
An amazing website that allows me to virtually battle with a random selected dog and shows a fact about this pet.

## User Story
AS AN animal lover

I WANT to be able to create a user-friendly game

SO THAT my chosen pet can virtually battle another random pet


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN the Pet Combat Chronicles webpage

WHEN I click on randomize based on a RNG THEN the CPU and I are assigned a random dog to battle 

WHEN I click on “battle” THEN the user will receive battle boost based on a back end dice roll, as well as the cpu. Whoever has the higher stats wins the battle

WHEN I finish a battle THEN I will see a fact about the winning dog
