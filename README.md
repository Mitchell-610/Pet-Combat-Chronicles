# Pet-Combat-Chronicles
An amazing website that allows me to virtually battle with a random selected dog and shows a fact about this pet.

## User Story
AS AN animal lover

I WANT to be able to play a furry user-friendly game

SO THAT my virtually selected pet can battle a random pet and I learn something new about the winning pet.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN the Pet Combat Chronicles webpage

WHEN I click on 'Generate YOUR Dog's Name' and 'Generate CPU Dog's Name' THEN a randomly selected combination of names from the database its assigned and displayed

WHEN I click on 'Randomize' and based on a RNG THEN the CPU and I are assigned a random dog to battle and an image for each dog is shown

WHEN I click on 'battle!' THEN a winner is chosen based on their breed, specified parameters and a battle boost provided by a back end dice roll

WHEN I finish a battle THEN I will a pop up will appear with a 'You win' or 'You lose'm message along with a fact about the winning dog

WHEN I dismiss the fact about the winning dog THEN I can randomize and battle all over
